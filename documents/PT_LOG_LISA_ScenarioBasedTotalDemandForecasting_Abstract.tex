The supply chain of Robert Bosch Power Tools is characterized by short lead-times to its customers (48hours) but long replenishment, production and supplier lead times (up to 18 months). Therefore a precise demand forecast is crucial. This is currently done in a standard demand managment software which creates point forecasts of all forecast relevant base combinations up to the next 24 months. These are then fed into a inventory management system which calculates the optimal stock level and derives and automatically triggers then replenishment decisions using a complex reorder point heuristic.  The product \textit{Scenario-Based Total Demand Forecasting} of the PT-LOG program \textit{LISA} calculates distribution forecasts of the total demand of all forecast relevant base combinations up to the next 18 months. Certain percentiles of these distributions are then loaded into the standard demand planning system of PT. These demand distribution forecasts can then be used downstream to more precisely optimize replenishment and inventory decisions.
